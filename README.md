# An [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)-minded [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)  Web Application Template

This is an *opinionated* intranet Line-of-business web application intranet template, great for **small to medium**-scale web applications with maintainability in mind and flexibility to grow.
  
  ## Agile Development Manifesto
  - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
  - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
  - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
  - **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Service-Oriented Architecture Manifesto
  - **Business value** is given more importance than technical strategy.
  - **Strategic goals** are given more importance than project-specific benefits.
  - **Intrinsic interoperability** is given more importance than custom integration.
  - **Shared services** are given more importance than specific-purpose implementations.
  - **Flexibility** is given more importance than optimization.
  - **Evolutionary refinement** is given more importance than pursuit of initial perfection.

  *That is, while there is value in the items on the right, **we value the items on the left more.***
